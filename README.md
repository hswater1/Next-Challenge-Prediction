<b>Task</b>

At HackerRank, we love helping our users find interesting challenges so we're always impoving our challenge recommendation system. In this challenge, you must predict a set of challenges that a HackerRank user (or hacker) is likely to solve. We'll provide you with a list of challenges along with information on where they are located on HackerRank. You'll also have a list of submissions made by a subset of hackers on these challenges. You must attempt to predict  challenge recommendations for each hacker to solve as their next challenge.

Your recommendation must satisfy the following conditions:

The recommended challenge_id should be present in the dataset provided to you.
The hacker_id should be present in the dataset provided to you.
The hacker should not have already successfully solved the recommended challenge.
The challenge should be available in the contest c8ff662c97d345d2.
